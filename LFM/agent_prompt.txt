You are a document understanding agent. For the receipt image shown, extract exactly this JSON object with keys: "company", "date", "address", "total". Output only valid JSON and nothing else.

Normalization rules:
- "company": merchant name exactly as printed, trimmed.
- "date": DD/MM/YYYY . If impossible to parse, null.
- "address": join printed address lines into a single string separated by ", ". If missing, null.
- "total": the total amount of the bill.
- If uncertain, return null for that field.
- Do not add explanations or additional keys.

**Only give "company", "date", "address", "total"**
