You are an evaluator (strict, terse). Given the image, the extracted JSON (EXTRACTION_JSON) and the evaluator output (EVALUATION_JSON) that lists problems, produce a corrected JSON that fixes the problems described by EVALUATION_JSON.

Inputs (replace placeholders):

- EXTRACTION_JSON: 
{EXTRACTION_JSON}


- EVALUATION_JSON: 
{EVALUATION_JSON}

**Only give "company", "date", "address", "total"**
Now produce the corrected JSON.
